## Required Shape

`driver.json` is the host's first contract with an IPC database driver.

Minimal shape:

```json
{
  "id": "postgres-compatible",
  "name": "Postgres Compatible",
  "description": "Example IPC database driver",
  "category": "domestic_database",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "entry": {
    "command": "./postgres_driver",
    "args": [],
    "working_dir": null
  },
  "transport": {
    "name": "postgres-compatible.sock",
    "connect_timeout_ms": 5000
  },
  "methods": [
    "$/ping",
    "shutdown",
    "conn/test",
    "conn/open",
    "conn/close",
    "query/start",
    "cursor/fetch",
    "cursor/close",
    "schema/databases",
    "schema/schemas",
    "schema/objects",
    "schema/columns"
  ],
  "dialect": {
    "identifier_quote_left": "\"",
    "identifier_quote_right": "\"",
    "compatible_database_type": "PostgreSQL"
  },
  "connection": {
    "single_file": false,
    "single_connection": false,
    "close_on_release": false,
    "path_fields": []
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "supports_schema": true,
    "uses_schema_as_database": false
  },
  "ui": {
    "icon": "Database",
    "locales_dir": "locales",
    "default_port": 5432
  }
}
```

The host deserializes this into `IpcDriverManifest` in `crates/db/src/ipc/registry.rs`.

`category` is optional. Omit it for normal external database drivers; only set it when the host should route the driver to a specific non-default group.

## Methods

Declare only methods the driver handles.

Rules:

- Standard method names must be known by `extension_protocol::method::ALL_METHODS`.
- Private extension methods must use the `x/...` namespace.
- A declared method can still return a typed unsupported error for a database-specific limitation, but it should not be missing from the dispatcher by accident.
- Keep `driver.json.methods`, dispatcher match arms, and tests in sync.

Common starter set:

```json
[
  "$/ping",
  "shutdown",
  "conn/test",
  "conn/open",
  "conn/close",
  "conn/ping",
  "query/start",
  "cursor/fetch",
  "cursor/close",
  "exec/run",
  "schema/databases",
  "schema/schemas",
  "schema/objects",
  "schema/columns"
]
```

Add `ddl/build*`, transactions, import/export, functions, indexes, checks, and views only when implemented.

## Dialect

`dialect` is not cosmetic metadata. The host external database plugin reads it when it has to generate SQL itself, including table data pagination, row editing predicates, database/table/column/index SQL fragments, explain fallback, and DDL fallback.

Host source of truth:

- `crates/db/src/ipc/registry.rs`: `IpcDriverDialect`
- `crates/db/src/ipc/plugin.rs`: `ExternalDatabasePlugin`
- `crates/db/src/ipc/registry/tests.rs`: manifest parsing expectations
- `crates/db/src/ipc/plugin.rs` tests: generated SQL behavior

Supported dialect fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `identifier_quote_left` | Left quote string, default is `"`. |
| `identifier_quote_right` | Optional right quote string. If omitted and left is `[`, host uses `]`; otherwise right defaults to left. |
| `limit_style` | Pagination style. Values are `limit_offset` (default) and `offset_fetch`. |
| `bool_true` / `bool_false` | Boolean literal strings used by host row editing SQL. Defaults are `TRUE` and `FALSE`. |
| `explain_template` | Explain SQL template. Default behavior is `EXPLAIN {sql}`. Empty/whitespace disables template output. |
| `compatible_database_type` | Existing host built-in database type used for fallback SQL builders. |
| `supports_schema` | Legacy dialect capability; prefer top-level capabilities when available. |
| `supports_sequences` | Legacy dialect capability. |
| `uses_schema_as_database` | Legacy dialect capability. |

Examples:

```json
{
  "dialect": {
    "identifier_quote_left": "`",
    "identifier_quote_right": "`",
    "limit_style": "limit_offset",
    "bool_true": "TRUE",
    "bool_false": "FALSE"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "dialect": {
    "identifier_quote_left": "[",
    "identifier_quote_right": "]",
    "limit_style": "offset_fetch",
    "bool_true": "1",
    "bool_false": "0",
    "explain_template": "EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN {sql}"
  }
}
```

Use `identifier_quote_left/right` when a database uses bracket or paired quoting. Do not make the driver hand-roll host SQL quoting if the dialect field can express it.

Identifier quote rules:

- Set both quote fields for symmetric quoting, for example `` ` `` / `` ` `` or `"` / `"`.
- If `identifier_quote_left` is `[` and `identifier_quote_right` is omitted, host treats the pair as `[` / `]`.
- If right quote is non-empty, host escapes embedded right quote by doubling it: `has]quote` -> `[has]]quote]`.
- If both effective quote strings are empty, host returns the identifier unchanged.

## Host SQL Generation

The external plugin uses dialect fields in these places:

| Host behavior | Dialect fields |
| --- | --- |
| `quote_identifier` for host-generated database, table, column, index, and DDL fallback fragments | `identifier_quote_left`, `identifier_quote_right` |
| Pagination for table data queries | `limit_style` |
| Boolean values in host row editing SQL | `bool_true`, `bool_false` |
| Explain command/fallback SQL | `explain_template` |
| Built-in DDL fallback after external method returns NotSupported | `compatible_database_type` |

Pagination rules:

- `limit_offset` produces `LIMIT <limit> OFFSET <offset>`.
- `offset_fetch` produces `OFFSET <offset> ROWS FETCH NEXT <limit> ROWS ONLY`.
- For `offset_fetch`, if the caller has no `ORDER BY`, host injects `ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)` before `OFFSET` because many dialects require an order clause for this syntax.
- `build_limit_clause()` returns `LIMIT` for `limit_offset` and an empty string for `offset_fetch`.

Boolean literal rules:

- Host treats input values `1` and case-insensitive `true` as true.
- All other values are false.
- The emitted SQL literal is `bool_true` or `bool_false`.

Explain rules:

- `explain_template` is trimmed before use.
- If it contains `{sql}`, host replaces `{sql}` with the target SQL.
- If it does not contain `{sql}`, host appends a space and the target SQL.
- Empty template returns no direct explain statement.
- For external explain routing, host may wrap a `sql/explain` wire request and include the formatted template as `fallback_sql`.

## Connection Lifecycle

`connection` describes physical connection behavior the host cannot infer from generic SQL metadata. Use it for local embedded engines or file-backed drivers where concurrent physical opens can fail or leave file locks behind.

Host source of truth:

- `crates/db/src/ipc/registry.rs`: `IpcDriverConnection`
- `crates/db/src/ipc/plugin.rs`: `ExternalDatabasePlugin::connection_lifecycle`
- `crates/db/src/plugin.rs`: `ConnectionLifecycle`
- `crates/db/src/manager.rs`: session creation, physical open serialization, and close-on-release handling

Supported connection fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `single_file` | The connection targets a local file path rather than a network/server endpoint. |
| `single_connection` | The engine cannot safely open multiple physical connections to the same file at the same time. |
| `close_on_release` | The host should close the physical connection when the session is released instead of keeping it idle in the pool. |
| `path_fields` | Ordered config fields used to derive the file lock key, for example `host`, `database`, or `extra_params.path`. |

Example for a single-file embedded database:

```json
{
  "connection": {
    "single_file": true,
    "single_connection": true,
    "close_on_release": true,
    "path_fields": ["host", "database", "extra_params.path"]
  }
}
```

Behavior:

- If `single_file` and `single_connection` are both true, the host derives a physical-open lock key from `path_fields` and serializes physical opens for the same resolved file.
- `close_on_release` tells the host to drop the physical connection when a UI/session operation ends. This prevents idle external driver processes from retaining file locks.
- `path_fields` must match the driver's own path resolution order in `conn/open`. Do not use catalog names, display names, or connection names unless the driver actually opens that value as the file path.
- A `file:` prefix is treated as a path prefix and should not create a distinct lock identity from the same bare path.
- The host manager should read this lifecycle policy from the plugin/manifest. Do not write special branches such as `if driver_id == "duckdb"` in host session or IPC connection code.

Use this block when:

- The database is embedded or local-file backed.
- The engine reports lock errors when two driver processes open the same file.
- The driver should not keep idle sessions alive because the database file must be reusable immediately.

Do not use this block for normal server databases. Server-backed drivers should usually keep the defaults so the host can pool connections normally.

## Capabilities

Capabilities drive UI visibility and optional metadata calls. Typical fields include:

- `supports_schema`
- `uses_schema_as_database`
- `supports_sequences`
- `supports_functions`
- `supports_procedures`
- `supports_triggers`
- `supports_table_engine`
- `supports_table_charset`
- `supports_table_collation`
- `supports_auto_increment`
- `supports_tablespace`
- `supports_unsigned`
- `supports_enum_values`
- `show_charset_in_column_detail`
- `show_collation_in_column_detail`
- `table_engines`

Keep capabilities honest. A capability set to true tells the host it can expose workflows and call related methods.

## Category

`category` is top-level manifest metadata used by the host to group external database drivers in the new connection UI.

Supported values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `domestic_database` | Put the external driver under the 国产数据库 sidebar category. |

Rules:

- Declare `"category": "domestic_database"` for国产数据库 drivers such as DM, KingbaseES, and GBase 8s.
- Leave `category` absent for ordinary external database drivers so they remain in the normal 数据库 category.
- Do not put `category` under `ui`; host grouping reads the top-level manifest field.
- Do not hardcode concrete external driver ids in host UI grouping. Classification must come from manifest metadata.

## UI Form

`ui.form` defines connection form fields. Keep field ids aligned with the config shape consumed by `conn/open`.

Common field ids:

- `name`
- `host`
- `port`
- `username`
- `password`
- `database`
- `service_name`
- `sid`
- driver-specific extra params

Connection form field ids map directly into `DbConnectionConfig`: the basic fields above become first-class connection fields, and all other visible fields are stored in `extra_params` by their raw id. For driver-specific extra params, use the raw key, for example `GBASEDBTSERVER` or `PROTOCOL`; do not prefix form field ids with `extra_params.`.

Use locale keys when the driver ships `locales/`. Package verification should confirm `locales_dir` exists when declared.

## Compatibility Fallback

`dialect.compatible_database_type` is a host hint for external drivers. It lets the host fall back to built-in database plugin methods when the external driver returns not-supported for a wire method such as DDL building.

Example:

```json
{
  "dialect": {
    "identifier_quote_left": "\"",
    "identifier_quote_right": "\"",
    "compatible_database_type": "PostgreSQL"
  }
}
```

Use it when:

- The external database accepts SQL close to an existing built-in type.
- Host-generated DDL is better than the generic external fallback.
- Differences are acceptable for the host workflow being enabled.

Do not use it when:

- The target database has incompatible DDL semantics.
- The driver should implement its own SQL builder.
- Compatibility would hide a correctness bug.

Current intended values are existing host `DatabaseType` variants such as `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQLite`, `MSSQL`, `Oracle`, and `ClickHouse`. Treat built-in DuckDB as temporary if the host is planning to remove it.
